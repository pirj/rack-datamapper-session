This repo is not supported and has a major flaw: it doesn't clean up sessions on expire.
Please consider using https://github.com/minad/moneta instead:

    use Rack::Session::Moneta, :store => :DataMapper


To use with Sinatra, for example:

    require 'rack-datamapper-session'
    use Rack::Session::DataMapper
    DataMapper.auto_upgrade!
