This repo is not supported and has a major flaw: it doesn't clean up sessions on expire.
Please consider using https://github.com/minad/moneta instead:

    use Rack::Session::Moneta,
       store: Moneta.new(:DataMapper, setup: (ENV['DATABASE_URL'] || "sqlite://#{Dir.pwd}/development.db"))


To use with Sinatra, for example:

    require 'rack-datamapper-session'
    use Rack::Session::DataMapper
    DataMapper.auto_upgrade!
